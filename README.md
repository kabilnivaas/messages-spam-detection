Images-spam-detection
This project focuses on building a spam detection system for text messages using machine learning techniques. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract, this system identifies and classifies messages as spam or non-spam with high accuracy. The aim is to automate spam filtering for message data, which can be useful for reducing unwanted messages in digital communications.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Prepares raw text data for analysis through tokenization, stop-word removal, and other NLP techniques.
OCR with Tesseract: Extracts text from image-based message data for comprehensive spam analysis.
Machine Learning Classifier: Utilizes various algorithms to classify messages as spam or non-spam, evaluating model performance to select the most accurate classifier.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the spam classification model.
**Technologies Used**
  Python
  OpenCV
  Tesseract OCR
  Scikit-Learn
  NLTK
  Pandas
**Usage**
This repository can be used as a framework for implementing spam detection models for Image-based message systems, with applications in messaging apps, email filtering, and customer support automation.
